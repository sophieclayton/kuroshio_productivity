\begin{abstract}
The depth of the nutricline and the magnitude of vertical nutrient fluxes have a direct influence on primary productivity and the strength of the biological carbon pump. Western boundary currents have been shown to be hotspots for carbon cycling, largely due to their high levels of eddy kinetic energy superimposed over large latitudinal gradients in physical and biogeochemical properties. The presence of mesoscale eddies and submesoscale filaments drives variability in the mixed layer and the nutricline depth over a wide range of space and time scales. The Kuroshio and Oyashio have been shown to act as large-scale subsurface nutrient streams, supporting large lateral transports of nutrients within the upper thermocline, and these nutrient streams are characterized by persistent along-isopycnal positive nitrate anomalies. However the extent of the spatial and temporal variability of the nutricline depth in the north western Pacific is not well known, partly due to the relatively sparse number of nutrient profiles over the broader region. In this study, data from a large number of continuous nitrate profiles from BGC-Argo floats deployed in the western Pacific, spanning multiple years and seasons, are used to determine temporal and spatial variability in the nutricline depth and nitrate fluxes, and how they relate to physical dynamics and primary productivity estimated from remote sensing.
