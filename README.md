# Synoptic Mesoscale to Basin Scale Variability in Biological Productivity and Chlorophyll in the Kuroshio Extension Region
This repository contains jupyter notebooks with the code used to analysis the spatial and temporal variability of productivity in the Kuroshio Extenison region estimated from O2/Ar. [This work has now been published in the Journal Of Geophysical Research: Oceans](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JC017782).

The code is a bit ugly and should be tidied up. I'm grabbing chunks of code from here to build a package of functions for follow-on projects.
